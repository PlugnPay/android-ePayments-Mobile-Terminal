Here is a very early beta build of the ePayments Mobile Terminal app.

It's very rough around the edges & the branding is not 100% correct, but things will be cleaned up in due time.

This version contains updates to the mobile app, so it can be used MagTek BulleT & is compiled with newer versions of Android in mind, so it should be a bit more stable.


FIRST TIME SETUP:

- Side load this APK normally to your mobile device.

- When you start the app, click on the menu button on your device & click on the small circular arrow at the top of the screen.

- When the app menu displays, click, on the Setup  button.

- In the setup screen, click on the demo button to disable the demo mode

- Then add your your PlugnPay username near the top.

- Select the option to save your username for future usage.

- Select the option to enable the credit card reader ability; if you’re using a MagTek Bullet.

- Click on the save button & you're done...


* NOTE:  If not using a MagTek BulleT card reader, you’re done. You may simply skip what’s below.


HOW TO SWIPE A CARD:

** This section will assume you have already paired your BulleT via Bluetooth with your Android device & have setup the app per the above instructions.

- Open the ePayments Mobile Terminal app

- Turn on your BulleT, it's light should flash green continually.

- Go back into the app menu & click on the setting button.

- Select your BulleT from the list of devices.

- Your BulleT should now have a solid green light. This means your reader is activated for a swipe.

- Use the back button of your mobile device to go back to the mobile termal page

- Swipe the card through the reader.

- You will either be told it's a good swipe or bad swipe swipe.

- If its a good swipe, you can enter an amount & continue forward.

- However if it's a bad swipe, turn your BulleT on again & re-select it from the app menu's setup screen to make it connect again, go back to the page & try your swipe again'

* A quick connect button is missing from this build of the app, that will greatly simplify the swipe process. This is something we plan to addressed in the newer releases. Until then, using this slightly round about method will work, so you can begin swiping cards immediately.

* If you have problems with a mobile app, you should register your mobile device's ID within the 'Device Management' section of your PlugnPay account's Security Administration area.  There is a 'Device ID' button within the settings screen of the mobile app, that will tell you what device ID to register.  [If you don't see this section in your PlugnPay account, please let us know.]
