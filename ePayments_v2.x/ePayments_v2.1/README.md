How To Swipe During Checkout
[This assumes you have a compatible Bluetooth swiper registered in the app]

    1. Open the app & proceed with the checkout normally
    2. When you reach the place where customer’s card # is asked for, turn on your Bluetooth swiper
    3. Click on the Credit Card icon at top-right of screen & it should indicate when swiper connects
(you’d know this worked, as the swiper’s light should become steady, instead of flashing)
    4. Swipe the customer’s card through the reader
    5. If swipe was accepted, you’d see the customer’s name, card # & exp date populated in the form
    6. If swipe was rejected, you should be notified accordingly. Simply try again from step #2
    7. Once the swipe has been accepted, complete the rest of checkout process normally

Ancillary Notes

    • This Android app presently supports MagTek Bullet & eDynamo mobile card readers
    • The reader must be injected with key ‘90125100’ when ordered from MagTek to be compatible
    • The Mobile Terminal Password is not the same thing as your gateway account’s login password
    • The Mobile Terminal Password can be configured in your account’s Security Administration area, in the Username/Password Configuration sub-section.
    • Printing from this app is a BETA feature & uses the native print abilities of the most current version of Android (9/Pie presently). This means the print option may not be compatible with all versions of Android or with certain vendor’s modified Android versions. YMMV
    • Questions & issues with this app should be reported directly to tech support for assistance
