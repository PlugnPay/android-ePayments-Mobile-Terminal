This is the original versions of our ePayments app.
- its UI is more consistent, but an older style
- it doesn't have several features/abilities of the Apple version
- there's a bug with using certain MagTek readers with it, but keying in card #s works just fine.

* If you intend to use a MagTek BulleT, don't use this version.
