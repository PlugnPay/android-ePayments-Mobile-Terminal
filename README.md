* For mobile card readers, must be a compatiable reader, with our encryption key inkjected into it by the manfacturer.

## History

* Version 1.x - is for older Android devices, only supports keying in card data. [MagTek BulleT usage is no longer functional]
* Version 2.x - is for newer Android devices, which supports keying in card data, plus ability to use MagTek Bullet/eDynamo swipers.

NOTES: 
- Mobile swiper ability appears in the 1.x APKs, but it's no longer functional, due to changes in our gateway. Only key-in method works.
- MagTek BulleT & eDynamo are supported in our 2.x APKs, but MUST be injected with our encryption key when ordered from MagTek.
- MagTek eDynamo is supported in the newest 2.x version of our APKs, but is for swipe use only. It does not do EMV.
